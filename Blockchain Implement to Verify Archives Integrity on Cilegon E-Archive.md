# Blockchain Implement to Verify Archives Integrity on Cilegon E-Archive

- The new CEA(Cilegon E-Archive) system that integrates IPFS and Ethereum private network as developed into CEA DAPP. This new archive management system improved the system security such as availability, confidentiality and integrity.
# Problem statement
- existing CEA system has some problems
  - single point of failure : When the server goes down, then the entire system stop working.
  - low data availability : The server goes down, client can't connect to the server, so the system can't process requests to provide data. Therefore, users could be lose data.
  - difficulty in proving the originality of files : The archivists allowed to alter the archives, so the existing system cannot guarantee whether the modifications are valid.
# New CEA system architecture consists of
### Users
- consist of an administrator for registering and monitoring and other users(archivists)
- users has two identities
  - peer ID : interacting with IPFS private network
  - Ethereum address : for communicating with CEA network
### CEA DApp
- to developed as a front-end system, to make it more convenient for the users
- users must install Metamask to run CEA DApp
  - Metamask import Ethereum addresses
- has a smart contract to store and retrieve the hash in CEA Network
### IPFS private network
- To make IPFS network privately, all nodes must have the same swarm key which is generated by boot node
- There could be a Boot Node which is like administrater and all other users are Client nodes
- RSA algorithm is used to generate public/private key pairs to authenticate peers in IPFS
### CEA Network (Ethereum private network)
- to maintain file confidentiality
- generate Ethereum address
- create a block with basic information such as chainID, difficulty, gasLimit, and alloc
# System scenarios
- registration on IPFS private network
- registration on CEA network
- uploading a file on CEA system
- downloading a file on CEA system
