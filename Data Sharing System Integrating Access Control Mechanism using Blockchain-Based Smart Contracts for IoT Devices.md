# Data Sharing System Integrating Access Control Mechanism using Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts for IoT Devices

# Problem Statement
- growth of the IoT networks results in many challenges such as illegitimate data sharing, unauthorized access control, unauthenticated users, single point of failure due to centralization, etc.
- for interacting between IoT devices, the blockchain-based system need to achieve:
  - trustfulness and authentication for data sharing 
  - authorization and privileged for access control
